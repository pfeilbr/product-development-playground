## Wardley Mapping

> A Wardley Map is a representation of the landscape in which a business operates. It consists of a value chain (activities needed to fulfill user needs) graphed against evolution (how individual activities change over time under supply and demand competition). A Wardley Map represents the situational awareness and shared assumptions being made about a context and hints at what strategic options are available.

**Key Points**

* use mapping as a way to quickly validate solutions and avoid costly mistakes – to identify what to build, buy and outsource
* map minimizes the chance that I’ll miss something important
* a more evolved component can be outsourced and treated like a building block, while a less evolved component usually needs to be built from scratch or given other special consideration (money, time and energy).
* The real danger is in mistreating a more evolved component by building it from scratch.
* Outsourcing highly evolved components is a critical aspect of building cost-effective solutions.
* Since you have limited resources, it makes sense to save them for the components that actually need special treatment.

**Map**

* Y-axis - value chain.  invisible (bottom) to visible (top). user at top
* X-axis - genesis *(new, uncertain, failure-prone)*, custom, product, commodity *(old, boring, reliable)*
