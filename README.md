## Wardley Mapping

> A Wardley Map is a representation of the landscape in which a business operates. It consists of a value chain (activities needed to fulfill user needs) graphed against evolution (how individual activities change over time under supply and demand competition). A Wardley Map represents the situational awareness and shared assumptions being made about a context and hints at what strategic options are available.

**Key Points**

* use mapping as a way to quickly validate solutions and avoid costly mistakes – to identify what to build, buy and outsource
* map minimizes the chance that I’ll miss something important

**Map**

* Y-axis - value chain.  invisible (bottom) to visible (top). user at top
* X-axis - genesis, custom, product, commodity

**Example(s)**
